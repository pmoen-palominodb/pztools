DBGranter

a CGI script written in bash that can be used to quickly edit basic grants for a MySQL user.

The user using this tool must have proper grants on the database from the host the CGI script runs from (GRANT OPTION).

The script runs under apache httpd, put it in the cgi-bin directory and configure accordingly.
 
WATCH OUT: this is early stage software. Bugs are there. 

Feedbacks welcome!
Enjoy
