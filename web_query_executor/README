Web Query Executor:

a CGI script written in bash that can be used to execute DML against a MySQL database in a somewhat 
safe manner.

What you get:

- automatic rollback scripts to revert the changes the query will apply
- automatic check for PK and/or index use (avoid locking table scans!!)
- dry run capability (check query and compute rollback statements without modifying the data)
- log of everything executed against the database
- transaction consistency: all queries are run within the same transaction so an all-or-nothing modification is enforced
- last_insert_id and variables are supported!

The user using this script must have proper grants on the database from the host the CGI script runs from.
The script runs under apache httpd, put it in the cgi-bin directory and configure accordingly.
 
WATCH OUT: this is early stage software. Bugs are there. Make sure to always check the rollback code in 
dry run mode before you run the actual changes.

EXAMPLE USAGE WITH VARIABLES:

set @myvar1 =  (select val from rick.t1 where val=12121 and id = 1021);
set @myvar2 =  (select val from rick.t1 where id = 1385);
set @myvar3 =  (select 666);
insert into t1 (val) values (@myvar1);
insert into t1 (val) values (@last_insert_id), (@myvar2), (@myvar3);


Feedbacks welcome!
Enjoy
